# HORECA_ZOMATO_TMP
🍽️ Zomato Market Intelligence Analysis

This project presents the final outcomes and insights from an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) conducted on the Zomato dataset.
The study was designed to support Chef Innovator, a new entrepreneur entering the HORECA (Hotel, Restaurant, Café) sector, by identifying profitable cuisines, promising cities, and optimal sales channels.

🎯 Project Outcome
🥘 1. Cuisine Insights

Top-performing cuisines (based on rating, popularity, and affordability) are Fast Food, Desserts, and Pizza.

Low-performing cuisines like Continental and Mughlai have higher prices but lower engagement.

Optimal strategy: Focus on high-demand, mid-price cuisines that yield consistent ratings.

🏙️ 2. Market (City) Insights

Hyderabad, Jaipur, and Kochi emerge as high-potential markets — strong ratings with moderate competition.

Mumbai and Bangalore are overcrowded, making entry riskier despite high demand.

Smaller cities like Raipur and Lucknow show growth potential due to increasing consumer engagement.

🚚 3. Channel (Dining vs Delivery) Insights

Delivery channels outperform Dining in consistency and reach.

Dining ratings fluctuate more due to service and ambience dependency.

Recommendation: Launch with Delivery-first strategy, followed by selective dining options.

⚖️ 4. Risk–Return Analysis

Cities with moderate competition and high average ratings represent the best ROI opportunities.

Price sensitivity analysis shows that customers prefer value-for-money restaurants over premium-priced ones.

Balanced markets: Kochi, Jaipur, Hyderabad.

High-risk markets: Mumbai, Delhi, Bangalore.

💡 Final Recommendation
Decision Area	Strategic Recommendation
Cuisine	Focus on Fast Food, Pizza, and Desserts.
